Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you will:

•	Know fundamental concepts and techniques of the Artificial Neural Network and Convolution Neural Networks

•	Gain a broad understanding of image data.

•	Work with Sequential type of modelling

•	Work with Keras capabilities

•	Work with image processing techniques

•	know how to build a web application using the Flask framework.

Project Flow:
•	The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) to upload the image as input

•	The uploaded image is analysed by the model which is integrated

•	Once the model analyses the uploaded image, the prediction is showcased on the UI



To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below
•	Understanding the data.

o	Importing the required libraries

o	Loading the data

o	Analysing the data

o	Reshaping the data.

o	Applying One Hot Encoding


•	Model Building

o	 Creating the model and adding the input, hidden and output layers to it

o	Compiling the model

o	Training the model

o	 Predicting the result

o	Testing the model by taking image inputs

o	Saving the model


•	Application Building

o	Create an HTML file

o	Build Python Code
