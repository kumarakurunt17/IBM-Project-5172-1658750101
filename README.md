Project Objectives
By the end of this project, you will:
•	Know fundamental concepts and techniques of the Artificial Neural Network and Convolution Neural Networks
•	Gain a broad understanding of image data.
•	Work with Sequential type of modelling
•	Work with Keras capabilities
•	Work with image processing techniques
•	know how to build a web application using the Flask framework.

Project Flow
Project Flow:
•	The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) to upload the image as input
•	The uploaded image is analysed by the model which is integrated
•	Once the model analyses the uploaded image, the prediction is showcased on the UI
To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below
•	Understanding the data.
o	Importing the required libraries
o	Loading the data
o	Analysing the data
o	Reshaping the data.
o	Applying One Hot Encoding
•	Model Building
o	 Creating the model and adding the input, hidden and output layers to it
o	Compiling the model
o	Training the model
o	 Predicting the result
o	Testing the model by taking image inputs
o	Saving the model
•	Application Building
o	Create an HTML file
o	Build Python Code
